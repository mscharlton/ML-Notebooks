# ML-Notebooks
Welcome to my personal set of Jupyter Notebooks.

These represent on-going learning of the math, statistics, and techniques associated with learning the foundations of Machine Learning.

While these are certainly basic and preliminary in nature, I hope that others might benefit from my initial attempts at implementing Linear Algebra, preliminary Classification algorithms, and general notes.

## Installation
This will assume a basic knowledge of how to run jupyter notebooks and using pip.  Additionally, I'm leaving out commands for a virtual environment, adjust as needed.

Note:  At this time, these notebooks were created without using classic Jupyter Notebooks.  Admittedly, I haven't yet updated to JyputerLabs

1. Install Jupyter Notebooks:
  - python -m pip install notebook
2. Install Notebook Dependencies:
  - python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
3. Run Jupyter Notebook and Enjoy!
  - jupyter notebook

## Posting additions or corrections
At this time, this is really just some personal notes and tinkering.  As such, if you find them useful, that's great.  But at the same time, I'm not really accepting PRs or other changes.  But who knows, ping me if you really want to contribute.
